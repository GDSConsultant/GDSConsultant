Hi, I am the Head of AI Application Design at GDS- 
-I am interested in technology and society and how the thoughts and ideas we have can benefit the world around us not just the Western World.
- Currently I am developing apps and learning more and more about AI, the tools and the impact of everything it is projected to 'touch' in the short and long term.
-I am looking to collaborate with others on the ever changing world of AI tools and concepts 💞️

- ⚡ The World Governments are fearful of the impact AI will have on the global society. This is why there is a rush to setup a plethora of committees to examine the 'ethics and moral values of Artificial Intgelligence. This is under the guise of controlling innovation to make sure it is safe to use. They will examine and suppress certain of the value in AI because it is counter productive to their control and existence - that is why more Tech experts need to be on these panels to bring balance and inclusion to view this innovation through every lens of human life for the benefit of every living person on this planet. The quote below is very relevant to this whole issue.
- Interesting quote below:
- “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” Audre Lorde
