Hi, I am the Head of AI Application Design at GDS- 
-I am interested in technology and society and how the thoughts and ideas we have can benefit the world around us not just the Western World.
- Currently I am learning more and more about AI, the tools and the impact of everything it is projected to 'touch' in the short and long term.
-I am looking to collaborate with others on the ever changing world of AI tools and concepts 💞️ 
- 📫 I can be reached by cell on 562 519 3893

- ⚡ The World Government's are scared of the impact AI will have on the global society from worklife to society. This is why they rush to setup committee's for this and committee's for that in an effort to stifle anything that results from AI can alter their view of the desired 'status quo'
- Interesting quote below:
- “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” Audre Lorde
